To use the X-Api-Key header instead of a query parameter, you need to make changes in both your client code 
(where you send the request) and the server-side code (where you receive and validate the API key).
On the client-side (e.g., Postman or your frontend application), you need to set the X-Api-Key header with the appropriate value instead of
sending it as a query parameter.
On the server-side, you need to modify the ApiKeyFilter class to read the 
API key from the X-Api-Key header instead of the request parameter. Here's how you can modify the doFilterInternal method:

 @Override
    protected void doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
    	
    	//This is the only line you need to change!
    	String apiKey = request.getHeader("X-Api-Key");
        log.info("Received API key: {}", apiKey);

       ......othermethods.....
}

What was the change?:

We're using request.getHeader("X-Api-Key") to retrieve the value of the X-Api-Key header instead of request.getParameter(API_KEY_PARAM).
