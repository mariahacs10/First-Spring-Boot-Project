my issue was i was using String.randomUUID() And that is NOT The way to do it
you have to create a seperate class with the apikeys you want to have, this is what it should look like:

public class ApiKeys {
    public static final String API_KEY = "your-api-key";
    public static final String ARTWORK_API_KEY = "your-artwork-api-key";
}

@Service
public class ApiKeyService {

    public String getRegularApiKey() {
        return ApiKeys.API_KEY ;
    }

    public String getArtworkApiKey() {
        return ApiKeys.ARTWORK_API_KEY;
    }

    public boolean validateApiKey(String apiKey) {
        return apiKey.equals(ApiKeys.API_KEY );
    }

    public boolean validateArtworkApiKey(String apiKey) {
        return apiKey.equals(ApiKeys.ARTWORK_API_KEY);
    }
}
