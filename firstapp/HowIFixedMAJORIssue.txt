MAJOR ISSUE!

I had a major issue, and the issue was i needed to change my ip address again, 
make sure if you ever needed to check your ip adress and update it do this:

Open the Command Prompt. You can do this by searching for "cmd" in the Start menu search bar and pressing Enter.
2.  In the Command Prompt window, type ipconfig and press 

Under that adapter, find the line labeled "IPv4 Address". The number next to it is your local IP address.

This is what it should look like:
Connection-specific DNS Suffix  . :
	...
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : IP ADRESS
    ...
    
Remember to change your react and also your android.

You can either do addCorsMappings or addResourceHandlers, But in this case, addCorsMappings
is better because allows you to configure CORS  URL patterns, HTTP methods, headers, and other aspects. 

But addResourceHandlers is good if you just want resource handling and stuff even though both work.

For my project i am going to use addCorsMapping.
